**MVP**

User journey:

- Navigate to home page
- Press link for what type of workout you want
- Navigate to selected page
- A selection of youtube videos to display either as a scroll down list or a horizontal scroll list that you navigate one at a time
- Idea to have the API call in the workouts helper to keep the workouts controller skinny - the show method pushes the id of the button into the api call
- Back button to home page
